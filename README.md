# TrueShuffle

There's a big problem with Spotify's shuffle button: it doesn't actually shuffle. Spotify applies certain heuristics and algorithms in order to improve the listening experience, at the expense of the randomness that the user might expect. TrueShuffle solves this problem, by taking the playlist, and randomly reordering it, so that you can have a shuffled experience without having to use Spotify's "shuffle" button/system.
